   Open your terminal or command prompt and go to `src/main/java/` within your cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd YourClonedRepoName/src/main/java/
   ```

2. **Compile:**

### Option 2: Running the JavaFX GUI Application (`PalindromeFXApp.java`)

1. **Navigate to the project root:**  
   Open your terminal or command prompt and go to the root directory of your cloned repository (where `pom.xml` is located):

   ```bash
   cd YourClonedRepoName/
   ```

2. **Compile and Run with Maven:**  
   Maven will automatically download all necessary JavaFX dependencies and run the application.

   ```bash
   mvn clean javafx:run
   ```

   This command will compile the project and then launch the JavaFX GUI window.
