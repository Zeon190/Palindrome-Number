# Palindrome Number Checker (Java)

This is a simple Java console application that checks whether a given number is a **palindrome**. A number is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward (e.g., 121, 1331, 12321).

## ğŸ§  What the Program Does

- Prompts the user to enter an integer.
- Reverses the entered number using arithmetic operations.
- Compares the reversed number to the original number.
- Displays whether the entered number is a palindrome or not.

## ğŸ“‹ Example :
- If you enter a number 121 it will return you the number is Palindrome(Because if you read the number from rigft or left it is the same ) .
- But when you write 112 it not the same from left or right the number changes to 211 .
